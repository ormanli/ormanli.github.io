I graduated from bachelor of science computer engineering at Yaşar University in 2012.
After that I begin studying master of science computer engineering at Yıldız Technical University.
I am currently at dissertation stage. I am working as a software developer at OBSS since January 2013.
I like playing computer games and trying concurrent, new technologies.
